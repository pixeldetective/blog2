<h1>Shakespeare's Sonnet 1</h1>

From fairest creatures we desire increase, <br>
That thereby beauty's rose might never die, <br>
But as the riper should by time decease, <br>
His tender heir might bear his memory: <br>
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes, <br>
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel, <br>
Making a famine where abundance lies, <br>
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel: <br>
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament, <br>
And only herald to the gaudy spring, <br>
Within thine own bud buriest thy content, <br>
And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding: <br>
Pity the world, or else this glutton be, <br>
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. <br>
